# SafeRoute AI – Bus Accident Risk Prediction System

SafeRoute AI is a prototype safety system for buses and large vehicles
that predicts accident risk using IoT sensor data and Google AI.

## Problem
In dense traffic, vehicles are often close together.
Distance-only warning systems generate false alerts and distract drivers.

## Solution
Our system evaluates:
- Lateral distance
- Closing speed
- Vehicle speed
- Traffic vs parking context

Google Gemini AI reasons over this data to classify accident risk as
LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH.

## Technologies Used
- Arduino (Tinkercad simulation)
- Ultrasonic Sensors (simulated)
- Google AI Studio (Gemini 1.5 Flash)
- GitHub

## AI Integration
Example AI prompt and output are included in the repository
to demonstrate accident risk reasoning.

## Status
This project is a prototype created for a hackathon.
