## IoT Accident Prevention Logic

The system uses ultrasonic sensors mounted on the left and right sides
of a bus to detect lateral objects.

Instead of triggering alerts based on distance alone, the system evaluates:
- Relative closing speed
- Vehicle speed
- Traffic vs parking mode

This reduces false alerts in dense traffic while detecting real collision risk.
